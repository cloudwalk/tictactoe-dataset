Here, let's proceed with a strategic approach for player X.\n\nThe currently occupied positions are:\n- X at position 6\n- O at position 7\n\nPlayer X should prioritize choosing the first available optimal position (center if possible, then a corner). The center is already occupied by X, and among the valuable positions, positions 1, 3, 9, and 5 appear to be empty. For this move, we will place 'X' at position 5 since it's a center position, which maximizes control.\n\nTherefore, the move will be choosing digit '5'.\n\nsubmit_move(5)",

They offer strategic advantage for blocking or future win setups, but the immediate concern is O potentially setting up to win or getting advantage.\n\n4. **Choose the Optimal Move**:\n   - Place X in position 1 or 3 as no immediate setup to block or win is available.

None currently exist.\n\n3. **Identify Blocking Opportunities Against \"X\"**:\n   - Look for any lines where \"X\" could win on the next move, and block that scenario:\n\n   - The third row has two \"X\" marks with a vacant spot at the end:\n     - Row: `7 | X | 9` (vacant at position 9)\n\n4. **Evaluate Strategic Positions**:\n   Aside from immediate threats or wins, consider placing \"O\" in the center (region 5). However, blocking \"X\" takes priority in the current board state.\n\n### Decision\n\n- Since \"X\" can win with their next move if \"O\" does not play at position 9, we must block that immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move for \"O\" is to place an \"O\" at position 9.\n\nLet\u2019s submit this move:\n\n```python\nsubmit_move(9)\n```",

Currently, 'O' is represented only once in the bottom right position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Look for immediate winning opportunities** for 'O'. Check if there are any two consecutive 'O' marks with an empty spot to complete a row, column, or diagonal. In this case, since there is only one 'O', no such opportunity exists.\n\n2. **Block opponent's winning opportunity**: Check if there's a line where the opponent 'X' has two marks and an empty spot. Identify those and block them.\n   - Bottom row: X, X, O \u2013 No immediate threat here as the row is already filled.\n   - Second column: 2, 5, X. If an 'X' is placed at position 2, it\u2019s a threat. \n\n3. **Consider advancing position for 'O'**: If no immediate wins or blocks are needed, look at setting up future moves.\n   - Looking at position 5, placing an 'O' will not complete a line but advances control.\n\n4. **Check for strategic center control**: Center control is often advantageous. However, \u2018X\u2019 already occupies the center in position 5.\n\n5.  **Evaluate corner positions**: Corners often provide strategic advantages. Check if there are any available corners.\n    - Position 1 and 3 are open and generally strategic places.\n\nAfter this analysis, the best move appears to be:\n\n- **Blocking threat or setting strategic position**: Position 4 is both blocking and near a position where the 'X's could align. It serves in controlling the mid-group section.\n\nBased on these steps, let's submit the move:\n\n```python\nsubmit_move(4)\n```",

The board can be visualized as:\n\n```\n1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n4 | 5 | 6\n---------\nX | O | X\n```\n\nThe player \"O\" needs to make the next move. Let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n1. **Blocking \"X\"**: Check if there's a need to block \"X\" from winning.\n2. **Winning Opportunities**: Check if \"O\" can win in the next move.\n3. **Optimal Play**: If neither blocking nor winning is necessary, choose the best strategic move.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Blocking \"X\":** \n   - \"X\" has two marks on the bottom row (positions 7 and 9). However, since position 9 is already occupied by \"X\" and there isn't another \"X\" in that row or column that threatens a win, no immediate block is required.\n\n2. **Winning Opportunities for \"O\":**\n   - \"O\" currently occupies the center of the board at position 8. Take advantage of the central position to build two possible winning lines: vertically and diagonally.\n   - Check if placing an \"O\" in position 6 (which is currently occupied), 3, 4, or 5 can help create a winning row, column, or diagonal in the future moves.\n\n3. **Best Strategic Move:**\n   - Position 5 is a central position and could provide multiple opportunities to win in future moves.\n   - The player \"O\" would aim to control the center and any other strategic position that opens up multiple winning possibilities. Position 1 is in a corner and provides a basis for creating rows and columns.\n  \n4. Evaluate moves by strategic advantage and immediate possibilities:\n   - Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are open.\n\n5. If no immediate threat or win: Select the strategic move that gives the most flexibility and control, which in this context is often the central position (5) or corner for future winning lines.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the strategic approach and current board state, I will choose the move that optimizes future configurations and offers flexibility.\n\n**submit_move(1)**: Taking a corner position for future diagonal or row advantage, taking away any potential long-term advantage \"X\" may seek.\n\nTherefore, let's finalize the move.\n\n```python\nsubmit_move(1)\n```",

The immediate priority for X is to either win or block O from winning in the next move.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. **Check for Winning Moves for X:**\n   - Positions 7, 8, and 9: X has already two marks in a column. There is no immediate winning move in columns because both marks are in the same column (position 8 is already occupied by X, hence no winning opportunity).\n   - No row or diagonal has 2 'X's with an empty space for a win in this board state.\n\n2. **Check for Blocking Moves Against O:**\n   - **Vertical Winning Block:** Examine columns:\n     - Column 1: Positions 1 (empty), 4 (empty), 7 (O) \u2013 No immediate threat.\n     - Column 2: Positions 2 (empty), 5 (empty), 8 (X) \u2013 No immediate threat.\n     - Column 3: Positions 3 (empty), 6 (O), 9 (X) \u2013 No immediate threat.\n   - **Horizontal Winning Block:** Examine rows:\n     - Row 1: Positions 1, 2, 3 (all empty) \u2013 No immediate threat.\n     - Row 2: Positions 4 (empty), 5 (empty), 6 (O) \u2013 Potential threat if row is filled.\n     - Row 3: Positions 7 (O), 8 (X), 9 (X) \u2013 Already blocked by X.\n   - **Diagonal Winning Block:** \n     - Diagonal positions 1, 5, and 9.\n     - Diagonal positions 3, 5, and 7 \u2013 Player O has position 7, but X covers 9.\n\n3. **Make the Strategic Move:**\n   Knowing there is no immediate threat and no winning opportunity, player X should focus on center control or corner and edge occupation to enhance future winning opportunities.\n   \n   - The center (5) is already occupied.\n   - **Choose Position 1, 2, 3, or 4**: Prioritize unoccupied positions for flexibility.\n   \n   Let's occupy position 1 to extend control, minimizing future threats and enhancing potential for X to win.\n\nBased on these strategic considerations, submit the move:\n``` \nsubmit_move(1)\n```",

Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.\n    2. Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.\n    3. Fork: Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).\n    4. Block an opponent's fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to make two in a row. Otherwise, the player should make a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it does not result in them producing a fork. For example, if \"X\" has two opposite corners and \"O\" has the center, \"O\" must not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner move in this scenario produces a fork for \"X\" to win.)\n    5. Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)\n    6. Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.\n    7. Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.\n    8. Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.\n    ",
